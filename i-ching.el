  "This package will show you an iching hexigram, and give you the
translation from the i-ching.

You can even plug in your own randomizer function, and/or hexagram
grenrator.  This package comes provided with a standard randomizer,
and a coin generator, but you could (for instance) build a generator
that grabs a random lolcat from icanhazcheezburger, and turns it into
a hexagram.")
  
;;; Installation:
;; Put i-ching.el somewhere in your load-path.
;; (Use M-x show-variable RET load-path to see what your load path is.)
;; Add this to your Emacs init file.

;;; TODO:
;; - the traditional Chinese casting method based on the date of the Chinese

;; - yarrow stalk method
;; - buffer method

;;; CHANGELOG:
;; v 0.2 - Hexagram lookup
;;       - Added Translated Judgment and commentary
;;       - added random.org randomizer source
;;       - added changing lines interpretation

`i-ching-standard-randomizer' - use the built-in Emacs random functions
`i-ching-random-org-randomizer' - use output from random.org webservice

In the future, the following methods will be available:
`i-ching-fuckup-randomizer' - use a illuminatus style randomizer.

Traditionally, i-ching was cast with yarrow stalks, or coins.  by
customizing this method, you can choose how the hexigrams are generated.

Currently the possible values are:
`i-ching-coin-caster' - Cast the i-ching, with virtual coins.

In the future, these ones will be written:
`i-ching-yarrow-caster' - Cast the i-ching with virtual yarrow stalks.

`i-ching-buffer-caster' - Cast the i-ching with the contents of the
    current buffer.
`i-ching-chinese-date-caster' - Cast using the chinese calendar.
`i-ching-western-date-caster' - Cast using the Gregorian calendar.

You can also write your own methods.  See `i-ching-cast-hexagram' for
help on writing your own caster.  Also see `i-ching-coin-caster' as an
