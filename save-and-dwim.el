;; The canonical version of this file lives on emacswiki.


;;; Commentary:
;; This file is currently in a beta state.  It needs some testing.

;; Frequently after saving a file, I will want to do something with it,
;; like compile, install and test on an emulator; send to a moz-repl;
;; load the elisp file and execute an interactive command.
;;
;; This elisp library will help automate these kinds of tasks.
;;
;; the theory is, that you have a discreet set of tasks when you save a
;; file based on mode (i.e. for a .el: save and load the file, for a .c
;; file: save then compile the file).  And then a set of tasks depending
;; on the file itself (execute the emacs command foo-bar-baz, load the
;; emulator and test, whatever.)
;;
;; This is where sdwim comes into play.  First call `sdwim-install'
;; which will set the local key to sdwim-save.  After that you will
;; need to set up some post save tasks.
;;
;; Per-mode sdwim tasks are set up on the mode setup hook.  Sometimes
;; you will have more tasks to do after a save (such as install
;; a compiled and linked file to a location, and run an emulator).
;; You can either write an elisp function to do that, or you can
;; use the kbdmacro facility provided.
;;
;; To use the kbdmacro facility, all you do is save your file, turn
;; on macro recording, and do your post-save-task once.  Finish
;; recording, and call `sdwim-set-last-kbdmacro-as-sdwim-action'.
;; It will save the current kmacro as a sdwim action.
;;
;; For instance, you could go to the top of the file, search for
;; the string ";;--run-tests--", go down a line, forward a sexp
;; and then eval the expression.  Assuming you had your unit
;; testing code all in one place, it would launch it all right
;; after save.
;;
;; If you need to, you can always record new macros, and use
;; `sdwim-set-last-kbdmacro-as-sdwim-action' again.  Each
;; macro is named before it is applied to the save hook for
;; sdwim.
;;
;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `sdwim-install'
;;    Binds C-x C-s to sdwim-save for the current buffer.
;;  `sdwim-save'
;;    This saves the file and then runs the registered SDWIM hooks.
;;  `sdwim-set-last-kbdmacro-as-sdwim-action'
;;    Gets the current keyboard macro, and turns it into a sdwim action that gets executed.
;;  `sdwim-edit-sdwim-kmacro'
;;    Edits the current sdwim keyboard macro.
;;  `sdwim-set-kbdmacro-as-sdwim-action'
;;    Sets the named keyboard macro as a sdwim action to be executed.
;;  `sdwim-add-elisp-function'
;;    Adds a function to the current sdwim hooks.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `sdwim-install-defaults'
;;    Install the default SDWIM hooks.
;;    default = nil
;;  `sdwim-override-save-keycommand'
;;    Override the C-x C-s command to run save-dwim instead.
;;    default = nil


;;; Installation:
;; put this file on your load-path somewhere, and load it in your .emacs
;; i.e. (require 'sdwim)


;;; TODO:
;; Look at the save hook to hook in sdwim

;; build in some really basic intelligence.  Start by looking at what
;; the user does after hitting save, if they execute the same task more
;; then x times in a row, offer that as a potential buffer-local-post-save
;; option.
;;
;; Allow some kind of project support so that tasks can be set up on a
;; per project basis, as well as a per file basis.
