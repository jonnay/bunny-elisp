(defgroup wsh-repl '()
  "A windows Scritping Host com-int port and REPL.")


;;; Installation:
;; Put wsh-repl.el somewhere in your load-path.
;; (Use M-x show-variable RET load-path to see what your load path is.)
;;
;; Add this to your Emacs init file.
;(require 'wsh-repl)
;;
;; You will also need to add the wsh-repl.js file
;;  - Download it from here: http://bunny.jonnay.net/sites/bunny.jonnay.net/files/wsh-repl.js.txt
;;  - I don't (currently) have a good place for this javascript file.  Sorry.  Pick a place you like.
;;  - customize the variable wsh-repl-script with
;;    M-x customize-variable wsh-repl-script
;; and point it to your file.
;;
;; Sometimes the WSH will complain that it doesn't have an engine for js files
;; if this is the case, you need to give js files the proper file association
;; inside of a windows command shell, type assoc .js
;; That will tell you what is currently associated.  Then use
;; assoc .js=JSFile
;; and all will be well

;;; interactive commands:
;; inferior-wsh-start-process

;;; TODO:
;; - Provide some useful examples of interacting with the Windows Scripting Host
;; - Look at the possibility of a deeper elisp-wsh bridge
;; - do better \n handling, look at moz.el
;; - run through checkdoc

;;; CHANGELOG:
;; v 0.2 - Fix bug where the path to the javascript wasn't being expanded.
;;       - Added multiline support
;;       - added command wsh-save-and-send-file
;;       - added command wsh-send-file
;;       - added wsh-send-region
;;       - added some better \n handling, not 100% on it.
;;       - better elisp error handling on start-process.
;;       - fixed checkdoc errors.
;; v 0.1.1 - Commentary update
;; v 0.1 - Initial release
